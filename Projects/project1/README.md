Modify the TCP server to act as a chat server.

v1

So far I'm able to:

- accept connections from one client and pass the data to another client
- keep this connection alive to allow data to be continuously sent from client 1 to client 2

Still to work out:

- allow multiple clients to connect, and specify a chat room to connect to
